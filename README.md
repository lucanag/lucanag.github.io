# Ableton - Sound Synthesis and Sampling work

This is a walkthrough on some of my Ableton learning process/homeworks which I have been experienced during taking a course at [Impro School](https://www.improschool.com).

# Sound Synthesis Exam

## Requirements:
1.  A project without using any sampler (Sampler, Simpler, Impulse, Drum Rack, etc.)
2.  Using real time, non-realtime input
3.  Using edited note, velocity
4.  Using MIDI controller
5.  Recorded, edited automation
6.  2 built - in software syntetiser
7.  2 insert effect
8.  2 send effect
9.  At least 700 word analysis
10. Presentation

## Synthesis Exam Work, Analysis - rule 30

### Inspiration

> I chose my inspiration source based on the topics which had the most influenced affects to my personality. These are the improvements in different sciences and my infinite curiousity regarding the future affected by our current knowledge in scienses. Stephen Wolfram, A New Kind of Science named book is which I recenty read and have been amazed ever since, especially the rule 30 named cellular automation model in it. ... The questions regarding future I encounter when I understand this model is which I wanted to use when I syntetised sounds to use a concept as  an abstract future picture on the improvements. This picture is not a relaxed idil picture, rather fulfilled with excitements, challenges, but in the same time with dark tone, atmospheric sounds which are not experienced in our natural direct environment. I followed this concept when I syntentiyed 4 sounds, based on its style I would say dub-techno especially that I was inpired by Heavenchord - in structure  and secquence.

> *"It always bothers me that according to the laws as we understand them today, it takes a computing machine an infinite number of logical operations to figure out what goes on in no matter how tiny a region of space, and no matter how tiny a region of time. How can all that be going on in that tiny space? Why should it take an infinite amount of logic to figure out what one tiny piece of space/time is going to do? So I have often made the hypothesis ultimately physics will not require a mathematical statement, that in the end the machinery will be revealed and the laws will turn out to be simple, like the chequer board with all its apparent complexities. But this is just speculation." (The Character of Physical Law - Ch. 2)*


### Implementation Process

> I divided my sounds into 3 groups, such as KERNEL, DRUMS, and ORNAMENT. The KERNEL and ORNAMENT mirrors my predefined concepts in Inspiration paragraph. Regarding the DRUMS I only tried to not modify the ambient, mystic mood by synentizing strong drums. From the 7 sounds I used 5 times Operator, once Analog and once Wavetable. I havenát used presamples, but reused some sounds which I syntetised in more channels with tiny differences. I used 2 times Send/Return Delay as I would have been using with the same parameters on top of those sounds.

> Firstly I started with the KERNEL - SICK sound which I tried to make as mystic as I can. Due to this I thought a substractive syntesis will be the proper from a rich sound, then I would slightly modify the Decay of the filter envelope on the Operator to receive an additional more dominant sound.

> Then I continued with the DRUMS synthesis where I used additive sznthesis or used only one oscillator with more audio effects.
> Then I still felt some lack between the overall mood and the inspiration part, so I started experiencing with the ORNAMENT group where I synthesised a PAD with the help of Wavetable and used some HIGH STUFF with Analog.
