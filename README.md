I will walk you through on some of my Ableton learning process and homeworks which I have been experienced during taking a Music Production course at [Impro School](https://www.improschool.com). 

*The course I take is in Hungarian but English language courses are also available [there](https://www.improschool.com/all)!*

## Topics
