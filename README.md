# Music Production Exam Works / Notes
*Luca Nagy*

I will walk you through on some of my Ableton learning process and homeworks which I have been experienced during taking a Music Production course at [Impro School](https://www.improschool.com). 

*The course I take is in Hungarian but English language courses are also available [here](https://www.improschool.com/all).*

- [Sampling](https://lucanag.github.io/Sampling/)
