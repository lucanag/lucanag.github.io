## Sampling Vision 

*Luca Nagy*

*You can read it in Hungarian [here]().*

The story is a documentary movie which is showed to the students on the Mars in the future on a history lesson. The story is about the **Mars before the colonization**.

1. The first third part of the documentary is about the surface of the Mars and it's climatic conditions before the terraformation, including the wind of the Mars which is unknown term for the students as the terraformation successsfully terminated the wind.

2. The biggest part of the documentary is about the discovery of the Mars and challanges of the discovery with the many many excitements about solving the most challenging questions on the colonizaiton and terraformation. The documentary highlight the rivalry of the nations on who to discover it first and how, the different space probes, space ships and target devices for exploring and study the Mars's surface. In this section I want a break which should remind us to the challenges and infinite brainstormings about how to terraform the Mars. So this break should be dark tone and should suggest some excitements and improvements which all happened before the people found the solution. The solution is also included in the documentary.

3. The last part of the movie come back to the drear uncolonized picture on tha Mars which it was in 2021. Samingly as all the good documentaries about a Planet ends, the end part shows the surface of the Mars as moving away forrward to the huge infinite space.

I will use the audio files [uploaded](https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/multimedia/audio/) by “Perseverance” named Mars rover of NASA which is designed for exploring the Mars and was landed at 18 February 2021.

-------------------
I want a background and dance music in proportion of half-half, regarding the genre I want some dub, ambient, minimal or techno elements around between 110-130 BPM.

### Inspiration

The main requirements of this exam which inspired me mostly as that we need to record or use any existing audio file and work only with that. As I am interested in the changes of sound properties in different consistence or atmoshpheres I wanted to record sounds in a totally different consistence or atmosphere first, such as under water on in different gas. Then I started research on what other Planet has any atmoshphere which can drive sounds and found that Mars has some kind of which is actually recorded by NASA. [maybe more about the radiowaves]
Due to this my vision was connected to it, which is a documentary about the Mars before the colonization.

### Implementation Process

I divided my sounds into 3 different groups, such as **CLIMATE**, **DRUMS** and **ADVENTURE**. In the part of **CLIMATE** I tried to give back the dusty, drear surface and climatic conditions of  Mars, while the exploration and discovery challenges in the **ADVENTURE**, while in the **DRUMS** I just focused to give back the elements of the predefined music genre. There are many sound in **ADVENTURE** part which are more dark but remind us some movements and excitements which was predefined. I also tried here to create some musical note not only noises and to create some pattern in the melody.

Since I liked the original records in raw form  already, I wanted to stay them almost in raw form too for giving back as much as I can the original mood of the records.

--------

#### 1. CLIMATE

(picture)


##### a, WIND

I used the first audio record from the Mars 

[First Audio Recording of Sounds on Mars](https://mars.nasa.gov/resources/25713)
 
 
This is the only record which I only edited a bit and left there in it's full length in order to keep the original mood of the record as a background noise. At some silent places I cut out and copied another part for being more consistent. Some of these places I used mirroring to drag the next section at null point. As the amplitude was vary I consolidated at some places and increased or decreased the amplitude and increased the Clip View gain value.

##### b, ATMOSPHERE

I wanted to symbolize the climate conditions here from another record uploaded by NASA. There is a record which we can hear the range rover own noises as it is moving on the surface and having some metallic sounds which was more strong and usable then the previous records I checked. 

[Sounds of Perseverance Mars Rover Driving – Sol 16 (16 minutes)](https://mars.nasa.gov/resources/25731/sounds-of-perseverance-mars-rover-driving-sol-16-16-minutes/)

I used two slices from this record. One to a background noise symbolising the basic element of the atmosphere (**carbon**) and a higher frequency metallic noise appearing at some points only (**metal**).

(picture)

I used Sampler at the **carbon** part in sustain loop mode in order to get a long released background sound. In order to use the note on part too and not only the release part, I increased the Pitch envelope's Peak for get little bit different sound. I cut off the high frequencies and used Vocoder and Echo with small LFO and high stereo effects.

(pictures)

I used one shot ode with a Simpler at the **metal** sound with a small resonance set band pass filter, small LFO to have some movements. I used Vocodera and Echo here too.

#### 2. DRUMS

(picture)


##### a. KICK

I tried to find a sinus wave from the records using in a Sampler to cut at null point, but for having stronger impact used in Sustain loop mode, not one shot.

[First Audio Recording of Sounds on Mars](https://mars.nasa.gov/resources/25713)

I increaset the peak of the Pitch envelope, filtered the high frequencies and used a Shaper. I highlighteed the low frequencies with Saturator and EQ Eight.

##### b. BASS

The BASS is made from the KICK, I only changed the attack of the filter eenvelope and increased the released time of the amplitude envelope. I highlighted different frequencies and cut out the 50-60 Hz part. I used Drum Buss here to have stronger effect.

##### c. SNARE

When I checked the records on the static laser shot of the Mars rover I thought it is perfect for SNARE and HIHAT, only a bit modification is required.

[First Acoustic Recording of Laser Shots on Mars](https://mars.nasa.gov/resources/25715)

I warped it in Beats mode and pulled each 8th transient to grids. Then I realised the amplitude value is not higher in every 8th beat, so I just selected a biggere slice and duplicated for having at least some pattern and be a little bit more static. 

(picture)

In order to fit to the genre I selected in the vision I used band pass auto filter and played with Drum Bass and Reverb. I used Echo for slightly driving the sound into another music structure section, such as at break.

(picture)


##### d. HIHAT

I used the laser shot records, but this time I left Ableton to create slicis based on the transients and selected a stronger one.

[First Acoustic Recording of Laser Shots on Mars](https://mars.nasa.gov/resources/25715)

I used Pitch tool for increasing the pitch and applied Saturator. For driving into another music part I used Echo and Delay.

--------------

#### 3. ADVENTURE

(picture)

This part has the most different sound which I chose by leaving Simpler to ct slices based on transients again. But here I used another record which was more vary in frequencies.

[Sounds of Perseverance Mars Rover Driving – Sol 16 (16 minutes)](https://mars.nasa.gov/resources/25731)

I used here NATIVE INSTRUMENTS KOMPLETE KONTROL M32 controller for experimenting with the slices. I freezed this channel as it contained the most sound and effects. I used 5 sounds, most of the cases used LFO and Echo, some cases Vocoder and Reverb.

(picture)

The **solution** sound is the only one where I tried to find a sinus wave and used in sustain loop mode to try to create a musical note. I used here Sampler, Pitch and Chord.

(picture)

The **storm** sound symbolise a climate, I used Sampler to cut the wave in the following way.

(picture)

At **strange** sound I cut a slice in the following way.

(picture)

At **question** sound I left a huge slice and used Vocoder.

(picture)

At **enhance** part I worked also with a longer slice with Vocoder.
